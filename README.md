### Project Overview
Week 2 of the Metro Bank Analytics Challenge focused on analyzing branch performance and efficiency. As a financial analyst, my task was to evaluate branch profitability, efficiency, and cost management to help the COO make strategic investment and operational decisions. Using the Branches.csv dataset, I created an Excel report with calculated metrics, PivotTables, Pivot Charts, and a dashboard summarizing branch performance.
### Problem Statement
The goal of this analysis is to identify which Metro Bank branches drive the most value, which are underperforming, and how resources can be optimized. This includes analyzing profitability, revenue per employee, operating costs, and overall efficiency to inform strategic decisions.
### Analysis Process
1. Data Collection & Import
- Used the provided Branches.csv dataset and imported it into Excel.
2. Data Cleaning
- Checked for duplicates and missing values.
- Standardized numerical and text fields for accurate calculations.
- Trimmed text to remove extra spaces and ensure consistency.
3. Calculated Metrics
- Total Profit per Branch
- Revenue per Employee
- Operating Costs and Cost Efficiency
- Identified loss-making branches and performance ratios.
4. Data Summarization & Visualization
- Created PivotTables to summarize key metrics: profit, revenue per staff, and cost distribution.
- Built Pivot Charts to visualize performance trends and comparisons across branches and regions.
5. Dashboard Creation
- Assembled the key charts and metrics into a one-page dashboard for a clear, decision-ready overview.
### Key Insights
- Metro Bank generated a total profit of $38.25M across all branches.
- BR012 emerged as the top-performing branch, delivering the highest overall profit.
- The branch with the highest revenue per employee achieved $198,379, highlighting strong efficiency.
- Several branches are underperforming, contributing a total loss of approximately $1.19M.
- High operating costs don’t always translate to higher profits, suggesting the need to balance expenses and performance.
- Team size isn’t always an indicator of success—some smaller branches outperform larger ones in efficiency.
- Regionally, the South leads, contributing 39% of total profit, making it a prime candidate for strategic investment.
### Recommendations
- Prioritize targeted investments in high-performing branches, particularly BR012 and those in the South Region, to maximize returns.
- Keep a close eye on operating costs, ensuring spending aligns with profitability rather than assuming higher costs will lead to better results.
- Study the practices of smaller, efficient branches and apply those strategies to underperforming locations to improve overall performance.
### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel – For data cleaning, calculations, PivotTables, Pivot Charts, and dashboard creation.
### Conclusion
- This Week 2 challenge gave me a deeper understanding of how branch-level data can drive strategic decisions. I learned to balance profitability, efficiency, and cost management while analyzing how team size and operating costs impact performance. Building the dashboard reinforced the value of visualization for clearly communicating actionable insights, helping decision-makers focus on the metrics that truly matter.
